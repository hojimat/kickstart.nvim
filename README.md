# kickstart.nvim

My custom minimal Neovim configuration. I was content with vanilla vim until my fingers started hurting. In fear of carpal tunnel syndrome I moved to Code OSS and really liked it. But the more functionality I needed the more json configs I had to write which made me think about configuring my vim. However, the extensions were pretty neat like linters, type checkers etc. But I slowly started realizing that many cool extensions were only available in VS Code version, which I didn't want to use. And when I realized that pylance is proprietary and wouldn't run on my Code OSS even after some hacks, I realized that it was enough and I am going back to vim. But I loved LSP aspect of the Code that I decided to go for Neovim. I immediately hated all distros --- it is not how I roll. And after a week of struggling with Lua I found out about Kickstarter, which I immediately loved. I needed to modularize it first but then I got my own personal working config. Nice!
